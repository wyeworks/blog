At WyeWorks we have been involved in many open source communities and we love giving back to the world, there are many ways of giving back, we always encourage open source project collaboration and development, but in 2017 we introduced a new tool to "give back" to the community: Free workshops for students.

We have carried out one Rails workshop in 2017 for around 120 students for two different Universities (ORT and UdelaR), and this year we are currently carrying out a React + Rails workshop for 90 students. We have learnt a lot during this time, and we want to share some tips on how to develop these kind of workshops for this specific public.
