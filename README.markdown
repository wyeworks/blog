# Intro

This is the repo for wyework's blog. It's based on
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/) and modified considerably.


# Blogging

These are the no nonsense instructions to get you right into blogging, assuming
you're a part of wyeworks's team (if you're not, you can [contact
us](http://www.wyeworks.com/), we're always looking)


# How do I publish a new post?

1. [Create a new post](#create-a-new-post) and open a PR
2. If the post is not ready add the `WORK IN PROGRESS` tag
3. If you want feedback from your peers add the `FEEDBACK` tag
4. If you think it's ready to merge add the `READY TO MERGE` tag

After it's ready to merge, the blogops team will publish the post to the site as
soon as posible.

## Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:wyeworks/blog.git
cd blog/
bundle install
npm install
npm install -g gulp
rake generate
rake preview
```

**Warning** *Make sure you have Python 2.x.x, the blog does not work with version 3.x.x*

Now you can preview the blog at `http://localhost:4000/blog`


## Create a new post

To generate a new post:

```
rake new_post['title of your post','diego_acosta']
```

The second parameter is the author of the blog post. Values for this are loaded
from authors.rb.
You can omit this parameter for blank author data or you can edit authors.rb to
add/modify author data.


## Writing the content

if in the last step you had typed `rake new_post['title of your
post','diego_acosta']` then you are going to find out there's a new file at
`source/_posts/2015-01-04-title-of-your-post.markdown` (whose date will change
according to your own time situation)

If we open this file, we'll find this:

```
---
layout: post
title: "title of your post"
category:
comments: true
author:
  name: Jorge Bejar
  email: jorge@wyeworks.com
  twitter_handle: jmbejar
  github_handle:  jmbejar
  image:  /images/team/jorge-bejar.jpg
  description: Software Engineer at Wyeworks. Ruby on Rails developer.
---

Initial content and excerpt that will be shown in the posts listing

<!--more-->

Rest of the post content

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
puts 'some ruby code'
{% endcodeblock %}

{% codeblock lang:css %}
#some-css {
  color: red;
}
{% endcodeblock %}
```

In between `---` you'll find the the [Front
Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block that has all the post
metadata.

Now add the category for the post (Examples: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Ember,
Management, Vim, etc.)

If you want to preserve the post as draft (avoid generation when publishing),
add `published: false`

Each post can be accompanied by a Hero Banner (1280x784 recommended) whose url
is specified in the `hero_image` property and whose file you'll have to add to
`source/images/heros/`. You can omit this attribute if you don't wish to
include a Hero Banner.

After the metadata you'll find some placeholder content that shows us the usage
for the `<!--more-->` comment to specify a post excerpt. This excerpt will
appear in the landing, and the excerpt and everything after it will appear in
the post page.

Now we can get right into writing our content in plain old
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)!

If you wish to include code snippets (and who wouldn't) you can use `{%
codeblock %}` [liquid
tags](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics#tags), with an
optional lang parameter. [Here is a list of available
languages](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/). For more ways to include code,
[check the Octopress docs on the
subject](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/).

Make sure to preview your blog post by typing `rake preview` and checking
`http://localhost:4000/blog`


### Building

```
bundle exec rake generate
```


### Uploading to server

```
tar cjf blog.tar.bz2 public
scp blog.tar.bz2 wye@wyeworks.com:.
```


### Deploy

The deployment process assumes the existance of a tar.bz2 file with the public/ content in ~wye/blog.tar.bz2
This is what was done in `Uploading to server` section.

```
ssh wye@wyeworks.com
sudo su -
cd /usr/local/www/wyeworks.com
./deploy-blog.sh
```

And you're done!
