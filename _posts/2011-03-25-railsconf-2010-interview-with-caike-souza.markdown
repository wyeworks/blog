We're opening the box of RailsConf 2010 memories! Yep ... we suck at journalism, so it turns out we have this almost one year old interview with Caike Souza we never shared before. So sorry Caike! 

Caike ([@caike](http://twitter.com/caike)) is a passionate agile software craftsman and founder of the [Orlando Code Dojo](http://orlandodojo.org/) group, where programmers get together to practice coding to improve their skills once a month. He is currently working at [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com/.)

Thanks for your time and great vibe!
